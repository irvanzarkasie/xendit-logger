# xendit-logger

This is the logger API, which will provide functionality to log an information into a text file.

This API can be started locally by executing the start-xendit-comment-app.sh script without any parameters. Doing so will run the node js app and expose an API in port 3001. The log text file can be found in the ./logs directory.
